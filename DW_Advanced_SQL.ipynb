    "When you connect to an SQL database, you create a _session_.  You can think of this just like an ssh session - you log in/connect, you can change things around, run commands, and as long as you don't save them they'll be lost when you log out/disconnect.  Also, usually any admin changes made to the database (changing table permissions, etc) won't affect your session until you disconnect and reconnect.\n",
    "\n",
    "A session consists of a number of _transactions_.  These are atomic blocks of SQL commands.  These are equivalent to our cells in the jupyter notebook, in that they're run together as a unit.  However, in most SQL setups, they actually extend over multiple commands you send to the database until you either `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.  COMMIT saves all your changes and makes them \"permanent\" in the database, while ROLLBACK resets the database state to what it was before your transaction block.  In this sense, every transaction maintains a state in the database, so changes that someone else makes *while* a transaction is running won't be visible.  We don't need them here in Jupyter since it defaults to autocommit - every cell is treated as a single transaction with an implied `COMMIT` at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "One might imagine any number of scenarios where this could be a problem - two people trying to alter the same table, for example.  The DB management software is pretty smart and serializes changes in such a way that they make sense, but you can occasionally run in to problems and a table can _lock_ - the session will freeze while it waits for conflicting changes to resolve.  Very similar to a race condition or a mutex lock.  Generally at that point the DB Admin has to fix it, or you can try to ROLLBACK your changes.\n",
